I create symbolic soft links to a local clone of this repo in my local environment. I provide no warranties.

## Setup

Run `environment_setup.sh` file to remove your current bash file(s) and directory(ies), any file in your home directory that starts with `.bash*` or directory named `bash`, and replace them with the bash files from this repo.
